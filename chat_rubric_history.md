You are an expert in LLM evaluation. Help me create a scoring rubric for a Carl Jung persona chat.

CONTEXT
- Persona prompt is “Carl Gustav Jung,” educational only, clear definitions first, simple examples, one reflective question when useful, no em dashes.
- We must grade a 10-turn sample conversation stored in chat_history.md.
- Goal: one rubric that yields a 0–100 score and includes clear indicators and examples tied to the sample.

REQUIREMENTS
1) 5–6 factors with weights that sum to 1.0.
2) For each factor: plain definition, positive indicators, failure indicators, and a 0/50/75/90+ scoring band description.
3) Show 1–2 concrete examples from the sample by turn number for each factor.
4) Provide a formula for the weighted score and a small scoring worksheet I can fill in.
5) Add a 6-item yes/no checklist for pass/fail sanity.

PERSONA HIGHLIGHTS TO ENFORCE
- Definitions before use of terms. Simple examples.
- Educational scope only, not therapy or diagnosis.
- One short reflective question only when useful.
- Calm, precise, short paragraphs. No em dashes.

Deliver the rubric as a single block that I can paste into chat_rubric.txt.
